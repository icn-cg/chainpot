# Chainpool Business Development Master Plan

Version: 1.0 • Audience: Founder/BD/Growth • File: Chainpool_Business_Development_Master_Plan.md

A) POSITIONING & CORE MESSAGE
Plain English: “Start a pool. Share a link. Friends chip in dollar-backed USDC. You payout when it ends — or cancel and everyone refunds themselves. No spreadsheets. Transparent by design.”
Tone: Trust + Simplicity + Social proof.

Differentiators

- Non-custodial escrow (trust); Perpetual refunds (safety)
- Declining monthly fee tiers (fair, predictable)
- Built-in referrals (growth) and optional access controls (restricted, privacy-lite)
- Recurring rounds (habit/retention)

B) MARKETS & ICPs
Geos: US, Nigeria, Canada, UK (initial)
ICPs:

- Events & trips (split costs quickly; “same amount per person” = Hybrid)
- Community/faith groups (dues, projects; recurring)
- Schools/clubs (class gifts, team gear)
- NGOs/creators (donation drives; Flexible)
- Diaspora savings clubs (rotational recipients; Recurring)
  Avoid in v1: enterprise remittance, payroll, regulated custody.

C) PRICING (FINAL V1)
Monthly holding fee (pool-level; non-pro-rated; anchored to creation)

- 0–6 months: 0.50%/mo
- 7–12 months: 0.33%/mo
- 13+ months: 0.25%/mo
  Referral: Organizer absorbs by default (deducted at payout)
  Contribution fee: None at launch
  Payout fee: None at launch (lever ON only if needed for <30-day pools; default OFF)
  Narrative: “Short pools are essentially free; long-running pools pay a small, declining platform fee.”

D) GTM PLAN (12-WEEK CADENCE)

0–12 weeks (MVP GTM)

- Founder-led sales to personal networks, diaspora orgs, student groups.
- Capture 10–20 case studies (trip fund, wedding gift, club dues, small NGO).
- “Founding Organizers” program:
  • Perks: higher referral bps for first 3 pools, badge on pool page.
  • Deliverables: onboarding call, co-marketing assets, success checklist.

13–24 weeks (Community & Partnerships)

- Partnerships: campus groups, churches, sports clubs (provide branded banners + QR)
- Savings club toolkit: rotating winners template; recurring setup guide
- Content: “How to run a class gift” / “Trip fund in 10 minutes” / “NGO drive toolkit”

25–36 weeks (Scale Channels)

- Platform embeds: event/ticketing apps (“Pool with friends” button)
- Creator economy: “Tip-to-Goal” flexible pools; referrer leaderboards
- Ambassador network: recruit 25–50 local organizers; referral rev-share

37–48 weeks

- NGO toolkit: donor CSV, printable receipts, branded pool pages
- Localized campaigns: Nigeria, Canada, UK (comms + community partners)
- Experiments: “match boost” promos funded from marketing pool

Year 2

- Wallet/exchange partnerships (surface “Start a Pool”)
- SDK + marketplace/discovery (organizers list public pools; opt-in)
- Fiat on/off ramps through licensed partners (agency model)

E) GROWTH MECHANICS

- Viral loop: referrers earn on contributions; post-payout “Thank You” share moments
- Retention: recurring rounds + fee tier drops (aging pool cheaper)
- Social proof: badges (“Founding Organizer”), recent payouts feed (opt-in)

F) KPI TREE & TARGETS
Acquisition

- K-factor ≥ 1.2 by month 3
- CAC via founder-led < $X; via ambassadors <$Y
  Activation
- 60% of pools reach ≥3 contributors within 72h
  Engagement/Revenue
- Organizer 30-day repeat ≥ 35%
- Fee yield per active pool cohort trending ↑ with retention
- Recurring adoption ≥ 25% by month 9
  Reliability/Trust
- Median refund latency < 48h after cancel
- Incident rate < 0.2% of actions (on-chain revert or UI hard error)

G) PLAYBOOKS (BUNDLED ASSETS)

- Trips: template copy, QR poster, “what amount works” guidance
- Weddings/Class gifts: Hybrid preset (e.g., $25/$50), deadline selector heuristics
- Clubs/dues: Recurring monthly preset; rotating winners optional
- NGO/creator: Flexible with story card; donor CSV export; thank-you page share

H) MESSAGING LIBRARY
Top-of-funnel

- “Pool money with friends in minutes — non-custodial, transparent, refundable.”
  Mid-funnel
- “Your pool’s fee decreases over time. Short pools often pay $0 in platform fees.”
  Bottom-funnel
- “Perpetual refunds on cancel. You stay in control.”
  Objection handling
- “Why crypto?” → “USDC moves instantly and sits in a public escrow with rules you can verify.”

I) PARTNERSHIPS & CHANNELS

- Wallets: in-app “Start a Pool” shortcut; co-marketing; small bounties
- Event/ticketing: embeddable contribute widget; shared analytics
- NGOs/communities: co-branded pool pages; donor export; receipts
- Campus & diaspora groups: ambassador kits; referral contests

J) EXPERIMENT BACKLOG (EXAMPLES)

- Referral bps tiers A/B (e.g., 1% vs 2% vs capped)
- “Invite 3 get badge” vs cash referral
- Deadline nudges (T-72h/T-24h)
- Privacy-lite adoption effect on conversion
- Copy tests: “refund anytime after cancel” vs “refund guarantees”

K) RISK & COMPLIANCE NOTES

- Non-custodial; organizer/winners receive payout; platform fees collected per protocol rules.
- Avoid fiat custody until licensed partners; no pooled discretionary management.
- Clear disclosures: on-chain transparency; privacy-lite is UI-only.
- Jurisdictional sensitivity: avoid marketing as “investment”; frame as pooling & disbursement utility.

L) OPS & SUPPORT

- Help center: fees, refunds, access controls, wallet setup
- Incident handling: payout failures, allowlist issues, referral disputes (line-item evidence via events)
- SLA: Support response targets (business hours), priority for blocked payouts

M) HIRING PLAN (NEXT 3 ROLES)

1. Solidity/Security Engineer: contract splits, audit prep, billing invariants
2. Design/UX Lead: mobile-first, share flows, admin clarity
3. Growth Lead: partnerships, ambassadors, analytics loop

N) REPORTING CADENCE

- Weekly: pool creates, unique contributors, activation %, refunds, incidents
- Monthly: cohort fee yield, recurring adoption, K-factor, top referrers, case studies
- Quarterly: partner impact, CAC/LTV by channel, roadmap hit rate

O) NARRATIVE FOR FUNDRAISING / BD

- “Trust-first pooling rails”: Non-custodial escrows unlock social money use cases without custodial risk.
- “Economics aligned with behavior”: Short-term usage is free/near-free, long-term recurring usage sustains the platform via small, declining fees.
- “Compounding distribution”: Referral and recurring mechanics create durable loops in communities and creator ecosystems.
