# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
# Run Hardhat tasks directly
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Prefer using root scripts when developing locally:
# From repo root
pnpm run chain:start
pnpm run chain:deploy:mockusdc
pnpm run chain:test
```
